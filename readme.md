%0|%0 is a fork bomb. It will spawn another process using a pipe | which runs a copy of the same program asynchronously. This hogs the CPU and memory, slowing down the system to a near-halt or even crash the system. You can run this simple code to prank your friends harmlessly. To stop this, you must restart your device (education purposes only)
